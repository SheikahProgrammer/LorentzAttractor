#Lorentz Attractor
This is a simple implementation of the Lorenz Attractor, a mathematical system that exhibits chaotic behavior. The implementation is written in Java using the Processing library.

##Installation
To run this program, you need to have Processing installed on your computer. You can download Processing from the official website at https://processing.org/download/.

After installing Processing, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Open the LorentzAttractor.pde file in Processing
Click the "Run" button in the Processing IDE to run the program
##Usage
When you run the program, you will see a 3D visualization of the Lorenz Attractor. You can use the mouse to rotate the view and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

The implementation uses the PeasyCam library to enable interactive camera control. You can adjust the camera parameters in the setup() function of the code to change the initial view of the attractor.

The implementation also includes an auto-rotation feature that rotates the view around the Y-axis at a fixed speed. You can adjust the rotation speed and axis in the draw() function of the code.
