# Lorentz Attractor

This is a simple implementation of the Lorenz Attractor, a mathematical system that exhibits chaotic behavior. The implementation is written in Java using the Processing library.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Processing installed on your computer. You can download Processing from the official website at https://processing.org/download/.

After installing Processing, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `LorentzAttractor.pde` file in Processing
3. Click the "Run" button in the Processing IDE to run the program

## Usage

When you run the program, you will see a 3D visualization of the Lorenz Attractor. You can use the mouse to rotate the view and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

The implementation uses the PeasyCam library to enable interactive camera control. You can adjust the camera parameters in the `setup()` function of the code to change the initial view of the attractor.
